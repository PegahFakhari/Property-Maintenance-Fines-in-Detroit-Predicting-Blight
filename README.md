Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?


Since I did not have a y-test, to compare models, I used 5-fold cross validation. SVM takes a lot of time to converge. The evaluation matric that was asked was area under the curve (I summarized the accruacy of the preditions as well).
